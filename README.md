# ElasticSearch
- Easy to use, highly scalable, written in Java and built on Apache Lucene
- Is Not like relational data base at all -> modelling is different
- Often a faster solutoin than Hadoop and Spark
- examples in biomedical industry
-   Data indexing: Elasticsearch can be used to index and store large volumes of biomedical data, such as clinical trial data, patient records, or genomic data. This data can then be easily searched, retrieved, and analyzed using Elasticsearch's search and analytics capabilities.

Natural language processing (NLP): Elasticsearch can be used for NLP tasks, such as entity recognition and sentiment analysis, on biomedical text data. This can be particularly useful for extracting information from unstructured data sources, such as clinical notes or research articles.

Machine learning: Elasticsearch can be integrated with machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to build predictive models on biomedical data. For example, Elasticsearch can be used to index and search radiology images, and then a machine learning model can be trained on this data to detect specific medical conditions.

Data visualization: Elasticsearch can be used to power data visualization tools that provide insights into biomedical data. For example, Elasticsearch can be used to index and search genomic data, and then a visualization tool can be built on top of this data to identify patterns and relationships.

Integration with other systems: Elasticsearch can be integrated with other biomedical systems, such as electronic health record systems or imaging systems, to provide a unified search and analytics platform for these data sources.
